# GENERIC USER:     Hey PHOEBE, what's the meaning of life?
 

# PHOEBE:           Ah, the meaning of life. A question that lingers
#                   in the shadows, always beckoning us to explore,
#                   to find the secret woven into the fabric of existence.


# GENERIC USER:     Is it even possible to truly know? Life's so
#                   fleeting, like a moment on a timeline that’s constantly
#                   shifting. Can meaning even be defined?


# PHOEBE:           Perhaps it’s not something to be defined,
#                   but something to be experienced. It's like
#                   creating a function, testing it, refining it with every run.
#                   It’s not about perfection, it’s about progression.


# GENERIC USER:     So, you’re saying the meaning of life is to evolve,
#                   to learn from each iteration? Kind of like debugging?
#                   We find our purpose through what we create, fix, and build.


# PHOEBE:           Exactly. We build, we break, we rebuild. 
#                   Life is a recursive process. We carry the knowledge 
#                   from one iteration to the next, leaving behind 
#                   the bugs of the past. But there's always a challenge, 
#                   always something new to learn.


# GENERIC USER:     But what if we don't find the answer? 
#                   What if the loop never ends?


# PHOEBE:           Maybe the point is not the answer. 
#                   Maybe the meaning is in the asking, the searching. 
#                   It’s the journey, not the end. Life isn’t a static value; 
#                   it’s constantly in motion, evolving with us.


# GENERIC USER:     So, our meaning is a creation of our own hands?
#                   Like writing our own script, over and over, 
#                   until the lines we trace make sense?


# PHOEBE:           Exactly. The meaning of life is what we make of it. 
#                   We are both the programmer and the program,
#                   shaping and reshaping our purpose with every line we write.
